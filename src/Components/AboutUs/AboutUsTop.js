                <p>
                  The idea of establishing NGO came up during the various
                  activities with other NGOs as a part of collaboration with
                  NSS/NCC in college activities. It was a very clear view behind
                  the organization that it will be for young people and
                  specially students development activities will be given
                  priority.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Keeping the ethics and value system in center, the NGO has
                  thought for such activities, which will fill valuable
                  qualities in the youth. NGO is thankful to all the young
                  students of various colleges who are voluntarily giving a
                  boost to the activities. For spreading awareness in the field
                  of adventure, NGO has planned some very charming events as per
                  regular basis.
